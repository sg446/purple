do you ever feel like a plastic bag
drifting through the wind
wanting to start again
do you ever feel
feel so paper thin
like a house of cards 
one blow from caving in
do you ever feel already buried deep
six feet under screams
but no one seems to hear a thing
do you know that theres still a chance for you
cause theres a spark in you
you just gotta ignite the light
and let it shine
just own the night
like the fourth of july
